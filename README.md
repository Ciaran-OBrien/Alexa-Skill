## Resonings

I have rececntly obtained an Amazon Echo, and as soon as I saw that their is an SDK for the Skills (Apps for the echo), I thought it would be a cool idea to see if it would be possible to make one in C#/.Net

After some quick research, I saw that there is a library in C# for the Alexa Skills, along with a toolkit for AWS intergrated with Visual Studios. I thought this would be a prefect idea to implement for this project, to inlcude Web Services, Cloud Computing, extra usage of my Amazon Echo, and of course, to help my fellow students to enjoy their pre-drinks.
